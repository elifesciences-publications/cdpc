To run the example, you must 
1/ install R (http://cran.r-project.org/)
2/ install JAGS (http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)
3/ install the R package rjags within R 
4/ put the file fit_model.R and data_FVB.txt in a directory that you will 
	define as the working directory in R
5/ run the script written in file fit_model.R 
(it may take a few minutes but if you only want a rough estimation
you can divide n.iter and thin by 10 to speed up computations)
